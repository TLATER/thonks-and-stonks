# Thonks & Stonks modpack

This modpack is intended to be installed and updated using
[packwiz-installer-bootstrap](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/).

## Installation

1. Install [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/).

2. Download the [bootstrap
   zip](https://github.com/TLATER/thonks-and-stonks/releases/download/4.2.0-release/Thonks.Stonks-4.2.0.zip).

3. Use Prism Launcher's "add instance" and "import from zip" to import
   the downloaded bootstrap instance.

4. Launch the instance.

5. It will proceed to download a variety of mods.
  - It will also bring up a window with some errors.
  - These are mods that do not permit 3rd party downloads, so you need.
    to download them manually.

5. Click on each of the mods in the error message, and read the
   message on the right. It will list a download link.

6. Download each of the suggested mod files from these download links.

7. Click the "close" button on the window with the errors.

8. Edit the instance with "edit instance", and use Prism Launcher's
   "Add file" feature in the "Mods" tab of the instance to add the mod
   files to the instance.

9. Launch the instance again, this time Prism Launcher will install
   the remaining mods and the game will start.

In the future, whenever you launch this instance, it will first check
for updates to the modpack, and automatically download them. Should
you get errors again, just repeat the manual mod download and
installation process.

## Extras

We recommend using the latest version of [Sildur's vibrant
shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/sildurs-vibrant-shaders).

This can currently not be installed automatically by the modpack, but
may be added in the future.

To install this manually, download the latest version of those
shaders, and add them using the "Add file" feature in the "Shader
packs" tab of the Prism Launcher instance of the mod pack.

You can then enable the shader using the "shader options" button in
the top right of the video settings.
